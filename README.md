  Prompt to ask the user his/her name

MMY HISTORY GUESSING GAME
  I then added a History Question game asking user:
    1. Where I grew up?
    2. Where in Japan I lived?
    3. Where I went to school?

CORRECT ANSER COOUNTER
  Added counter to track number of correct History Questions
  Also added a Switch statement to report out the results
  with a different response for each

BASIC NUMBER GUESSING GAME
  Also included a number guessing game (1 - 10)
  I told the user if guess was 'too low' or 'too high'

ANOTHER NUMBER GUESSING GAME
  I added another number game
  This time I made the user keep guessing until correct
  Added a check to ensure guess was a number and between 1 - 10
  Then inform user is guess is correct or too high or too low
