## THIS IS THE GUESING GAME ASSIGNMENT
===================================

### CREATED WEB PAGE
----------------
  Started with a basic HTML resume page

  Included ul and ol lists

### GET USER NAME
  Prompt to ask the user his/her name

### MY HISTORY GUESSING GAME
  I then added a History Question game asking user:
    -Where I grew up?
    -Where in Japan I lived?
    -Where I went to school?

### CORRECT ANSER COUNTER
  Added counter to track number of correct History Questions

  Also added a Switch statement to report out the results

  with a different response for each

### BASIC NUMBER GUESSING GAME
  Also included a number guessing game (1 - 10)

  I told the user if guess was 'too low' or 'too high'

### ANOTHER NUMBER GUESSING GAME
  I added another number game

  This time I made the user keep guessing until correct

  Added a check to ensure guess was a number and between 1 - 10

  Then inform user is guess is correct or too high or too low

### PAIR PROGRAMING https://github.com/limongoo/
  I helped turned the existing js into functions and cut down a lot of code.
